The goal is to make this at least a bit responsive.

- ✅Make a new html structure with some simple divs.
- ✅Maybe make a basic layout with a grid (recreate current layout of boxes). https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szablon:8TeamBracket
- Add lines connecting boxes.
- Make a bigger team bracket html. Maybe generate 64 teams (32 pairs): https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szablon:64TeamBracket
- Refactor CSS to be more generic? Or just add 64 teams variant.
- Try to make a new CSS variant that would re-create something like the split layout: https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szablon:64TeamBracket-split
	With CSS alone I would probably need to use a layout that only shows QF once.
